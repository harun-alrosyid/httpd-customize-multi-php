# httpd-customize-multi-php
This is a custom apache server capable of running multiple php on a single server

Every year technology is always changing, improving and adjusting.
But often at certain times we don't need to follow it because our system is quite mature. But on the other hand there is a new system that we want to install and should not affect the system that has been around for a long time.
Example: If you have an application that runs pretty well on PHP version 5 but my new application is only able to run on version 7 then it's not the old application that we need to update. what we have to do is how to do both well.
This Respository is the solution to the above problems.
